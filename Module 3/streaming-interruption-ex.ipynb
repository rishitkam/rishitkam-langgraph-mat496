      "\n",
      "• **Ad Astra (2019) - Sci-Fi, Adventure**  \n",
      "   This movie explores the psychological aspects of space exploration, with a focus on a father-son relationship and a journey to the outer edges of the solar system. Its introspective nature might appeal to you after \"Interstellar.\"\n",
