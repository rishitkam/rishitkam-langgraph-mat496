Video 1 : 
Learnings : 
This was an introductory video for the course, wherein I learned that a single LLM applcation alone can't do a lot of things hence many llm applications use a control form, with steps pre and post LLM calls like tool calls retrieval etc, This control flow forms a chain. LLM systems can also pick their own control flow, and that is basically what an agent is , "control flow which is defined by an llm". Some agents have less control over the control flow like routers control a single step in a flow, Autonomous agents also exist which can pick any steps or even generate its own steps and hence, auto-generate its own next move. As the llm becomes more autonomous, the reliability drops, langgraph helps to maintain reliability even with highly autonomous agents by using features like persistence, streaming, human in the loop & controllability.
